# tanstack-plugin-seo

Route-declared SEO for TanStack Router. Each route declares its SEO policy once, in
`staticData.seo` — the sitemap, `robots.txt`, breadcrumbs, JSON-LD, cross-links, and
the CI check all derive from that one declaration. There is no second place to update,
so nothing drifts. A public page that ships without a declaration **fails the build**.

The core and React entries have **zero runtime dependencies** — everything above is a
peer, and only the entries you import need theirs installed.

## Quick start

**1. Bind your site identity once.** Route files never see an origin or a brand name.

```ts
// lib/seo.ts
import { createSeo } from "tanstack-plugin-seo/react";

export const { seoHead } = createSeo({
  origin: "https://example.com",
  site: {
    name: "Example",
    logo: "/logo.png",
    publisherLogo: "/publisher.png",
    defaultImage: "/og.png",
    defaultAuthor: { name: "Example Team" },
  },
  organization: {
    legalName: "Example, Inc.",
    description: "What the company does.",
    sameAs: ["https://github.com/example"],
    contactPoint: { contactType: "support", email: "hi@example.com" },
    address: {
      streetAddress: "123 Example Street",
      addressLocality: "Example City",
      addressRegion: "CA",
      postalCode: "94105",
      addressCountry: "US",
    },
  },
  website: { searchPath: "/docs?q={search_term_string}" },
});
```

**2. Declare on the route.** Policy in `staticData.seo`, per-page content in `head()`.

```tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute("/pricing")({
  staticData: {
    seo: {
      kind: "page",
      crumb: "Pricing",
      sitemap: { priority: 0.9, changeFrequency: "weekly" },
      related: ["/features", "/docs"],
      link: { title: "Pricing", description: "Simple volume pricing." },
    },
  },
  head: (ctx) =>
    seoHead(ctx, {
      title: "Pricing — Example",
      description: "Simple volume pricing.",
    }),
});
```

`seoHead` returns the `meta` + canonical `links` TanStack renders into `<head>` —
title, description, og/twitter cards, robots, and the JSON-LD each page warrants
(BreadcrumbList always; Article, FAQPage, Service, ItemList when the instance
declares them).

### Extensible JSON-LD

The built-in generators are conveniences, not a closed schema registry. Define any
`schema-dts` entity, link it to the plugin's stable site identities, and compose one
site graph:

```ts
import {
  createSeo,
  defineJsonLd,
  extendJsonLd,
  jsonLdRef,
} from "tanstack-plugin-seo/react";

export const seo = createSeo({
  // site, organization, and website as above
  jsonLd: {
    site: (ids) => [
      defineJsonLd({
        "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
        "@id": "https://example.com/#product",
        name: "Example",
        applicationCategory: "DeveloperApplication",
        operatingSystem: "Web",
        provider: jsonLdRef(ids.organization),
      }),
    ],
    transform: (entry) => {
      if (entry.kind === "organization") {
        return extendJsonLd(entry.document, {
          slogan: "Ship with confidence.",
        });
      }
      return entry.document;
    },
  },
});

const siteGraph = seo.generateSiteGraphSchema();
```

`generateSiteGraphSchema()` includes Organization, WebSite, and configured site
entities in one `@graph`. Organization and WebSite use stable `#organization` and
`#website` IDs; articles and services provided by the site reference the same
Organization. Existing individual generators remain available and are not transformed.

Add page-specific entities through `seoHead`:

```ts
head: (ctx) =>
  seo.seoHead(ctx, {
    title: "Example for developers",
    description: "A focused description of the product.",
    jsonLd: [
      defineJsonLd({
        "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
        name: "Example",
        url: "https://example.com/product",
      }),
    ],
  });
```

The transform sees discriminated generated and custom entries plus `origin`,
`canonical`, and `entityIds`. Return the document to keep it, no value (or `false`)
to suppress it, or an array to expand it. Output preserves caller order and never
silently deduplicates entities.

**3. Serve the projections.** Build the graph from your route tree, render strings.

```ts
// lib/seo/graph.ts — also the module the CLI loads
import { buildSeoGraph } from "tanstack-plugin-seo";

export const loadSeoGraph = () =>
  buildSeoGraph({ routeTree, collections: [blogCollection] });
```

```ts
// routes/sitemap[.]xml.ts — robots[.]txt.ts is symmetric
import { renderRobots, renderSitemap } from "tanstack-plugin-seo";

renderSitemap(loadSeoGraph(), { origin, indexable: true });
renderRobots(loadSeoGraph(), {
  origin,
  indexable: true,
  disallow: routeConfig.robotsExclusions,
  contentSignal: "search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=yes",
});
```

`renderRobots` does not invent a Content-Signal. Pass `contentSignal` for
the value (the plugin prefixes `Content-Signal: `), `directives` for extra
group lines, and `transform` if you need to wrap or replace the whole file.
Preview hosts (`indexable: false`) drop `contentSignal` and `directives`;
`transform` still runs.

**4. Gate CI.** The same graph, the same rules, exit 1 on structural violations.

```bash
seo check
```

## Typed paths

Augment `Register` (the same pattern TanStack Router uses) and `related` /
`redirectTo` are typed against your real route tree — a renamed route becomes a
compile error, not a dead link:

```ts
declare module "tanstack-plugin-seo" {
  interface Register {
    paths: FileRouteTypes["fullPaths"];
    kinds: "page" | "article" | "hub";
  }
}
```

## The graph

`buildSeoGraph` walks the route tree and produces nodes (one per public URL) and
typed edges: `crumb-parent` (breadcrumb ancestry), `related` (deliberate
cross-links), `redirect`, and `collection-member`.

Dynamic pages — blog posts rendering through `/blog/$slug` — enter as
**collections**. Instances inherit the param route's declared policy, so
declarations stay the single source of truth:

```ts
const blogCollection: SeoCollection = {
  route: "/blog/$slug",
  source: "blog",
  instances: posts.map((p) => ({
    path: `/blog/${p.slug}`,
    title: p.title,
    description: p.description,
    publishedAt: p.date,
  })),
};
```

`checkGraph` runs every rule against the graph and returns violations at two
severities:

- **structural** — internally broken declarations; these fail `seo check` (exit 1):
  dead or duplicate edges, path collisions, a redirect in the sitemap, a
  sitemap/noindex contradiction, a `related` target with no `link` card, an
  instance without a title.
- **editorial** — quality smells, reported but non-failing: duplicate or mis-sized
  titles and descriptions.

## Coverage gate (Vite)

`seoRouteConfig` parses the route tree with `@tanstack/router-generator` (the same
parser as the router) and fails `vite build` when a page in an enforced group has
neither `staticData` nor `head`:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { seoRouteConfig } from "tanstack-plugin-seo/vite";

seoRouteConfig({
  outputPath: fileURLToPath(new URL("./lib/route-config.ts", import.meta.url)),
  publicGroups: ["(marketing)", "(docs)"],
  enforceCoverageIn: ["(marketing)", "(docs)"],
  alwaysDisallow: ["/dashboard", "/api"],
});
```

It also derives a small config module from the route tree: `robotsExclusions`
(feed to `renderRobots`) and `reservedSegments` (top-level segments an app must
not hand out as tenant/org slugs).

## CLI

The graph commands acquire your graph through `seo.config.ts` at the app root —
the `viteGraphLoader` evaluates your graph module inside a headless Vite server,
so path aliases, content plugins, and virtual modules all resolve:

```ts
// seo.config.ts
import { defineSeoConfig, viteGraphLoader } from "tanstack-plugin-seo/config";

export default defineSeoConfig({
  origin: "https://example.com",
  disallow: routeConfig.robotsExclusions,
  contentSignal: "search=yes, ai-input=yes, ai-train=yes",
  loadGraph: viteGraphLoader({
    root: import.meta.dirname,
    entry: "/lib/seo/graph.ts",
    exportName: "loadSeoGraph",
  }),
});
```

```bash
seo check                 # CI gate — exit 1 on structural violations
seo graph                 # the graph as a tree · --format mermaid | json
seo inspect /pricing      # one node: policy, sitemap status, in/out edges
seo inspect <url> --live  # fetch a deployed page, validate its rendered <head>
seo sitemap               # print sitemap.xml
seo robots                # print robots.txt
```

Stdout is data, stderr is status — `seo check --json | jq` just works.

### Audit any website

`seo audit` is framework-independent and does not need `seo.config.ts`. It
validates target URLs before making requests, follows redirects through the same
validation boundary, inspects the rendered document and discovery files, and
can collect Lighthouse evidence through a validating proxy.

```bash
seo audit https://example.com
seo audit https://example.com https://example.com/docs --json | jq
seo audit https://localhost:3000 --allow-private --probe-only
```

The report keeps evidence and findings separate: scanners collect observations;
pure rules classify structural failures and editorial quality issues. One failed
scanner does not erase successful evidence from the others. JSON mode emits one
versioned document on stdout, while diagnostics and artifact paths stay on
stderr.

Use `--probe-only` when Lighthouse is unavailable or unnecessary. Private and
reserved destinations are rejected unless `--allow-private` is explicit; that
flag is intended for local development and CI fixtures.

### Compare audit artifacts

Write timestamped reports from two revisions, then compare their semantic SEO
outcomes without failing on timestamps, timing, or other raw scanner evidence:

```bash
seo audit https://example.com --output-dir .audit/before
# deploy or check out the next revision
seo audit https://example.com --output-dir .audit/after
seo diff .audit/before/<report>.json .audit/after/<report>.json
seo diff .audit/before/<report>.json .audit/after/<report>.json --json | jq
```

| Change | Outcome | Exit |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Timestamp, warning text, or raw scanner evidence only | `unchanged` | 0 |
| Editorial finding or improvement | `changed` | 0 |
| Structural finding, scanner degradation, or lost coverage | `regressed` | 1 |

Inputs must satisfy the published `AuditReport` schema version 1. JSON mode
emits a separately versioned `audit-diff` document even when a regression makes
the command exit 1; operational and schema failures write only to stderr.

Raw scanner evidence remains in the source artifacts but is not interpreted by
the generic comparator. Performance gates should be expressed as scanner
findings with explicit thresholds rather than inferred from volatile Lighthouse
measurements. Finding payloads (`message`, `fix`, `observed`, and `expected`)
remain semantic: same-severity changes are reported as non-blocking `changed`
outcomes.

## Testing

Everything the CLI checks is a pure function you can call from a test:

```ts
import {
  checkGraph,
  hasStructuralViolations,
  inspectHtml,
} from "tanstack-plugin-seo";

expect(hasStructuralViolations(checkGraph(loadSeoGraph()))).toBe(false);

// render a page however you like, then assert the head it actually ships
const report = inspectHtml(url, 200, html);
expect(report.issues).toEqual([]);
```

## TanStack Start example

The [TanStack Start cookbook](./examples/tanstack-start/README.md) shows the complete wiring in
one place: route-declared metadata, the graph loader, sitemap and robots projections, JSON-LD,
the Vite coverage gate, and the CLI inspection and `seo diff` workflow. It is intentionally
framework-neutral beyond the Start route seams, so you can copy the modules into an existing
Start app and keep your own route tree and content collections.
