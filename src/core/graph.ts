/**
 * SEO graph — the derived model that projections (sitemap, robots), the CLI, and
 * the check engine all read from. Built from route declarations (`staticData.seo`)
 * plus consumer-supplied content collections. This module is pure: no React, no
 * env, no knowledge of where instances come from. Origins and env-derived values
 * are injected by the callers of the projections, never read here.
 *
 * A node is one of:
 *  - a structural route (`source: "route"`), keyed by its normalized full path,
 *    merging a layout route's declaration (crumb) with its index child's (kind,
 *    sitemap policy) when both resolve to the same URL;
 *  - a content instance (`source` = the collection's label), keyed by the page URL
 *    and carrying page-level metadata.
 *
 * Edges: `crumb-parent` (breadcrumb ancestry), `related` (deliberate cross-links),
 * `collection-member` (membership in a curated set), and `redirect` (route aliases).
 * The route walk emits crumb/related/redirect edges from declarations; a collection
 * may declare any additional edges its instances need.
