/**
 * A graph loader that evaluates the host app's own graph module inside a
 * headless Vite server.
 *
 * The SEO graph is built *by the app*: its module reads the generated route
 * tree and whatever content collections it owns, so it pulls in the app's real
 * module graph — path aliases, virtual modules from content plugins, bare
 * imports that only exist inside a server runtime. A CLI cannot just `import()`
 * that from Node or Bun.
 *
 * So this boots a scoped, in-process Vite server (middleware mode, no HMR, no
 * watcher, no HTTP listener), `ssrLoadModule`s the app's graph module, and calls
 * its exported loader. The graph comes back as a live in-process object — there
 * is no serialization boundary for the commands to cross — and the server is
 * closed by {@link LoadedSeoGraph.dispose}.
 *
 * Everything host-shaped is an option: the app supplies its own {@link
 * ViteGraphLoaderOptions.plugins} (a content plugin, an MDX loader), {@link
 * ViteGraphLoaderOptions.stubs} for bare modules that only resolve inside its
 * server runtime, and {@link ViteGraphLoaderOptions.env} for variables its
 * modules parse at import. This file knows about none of them.
