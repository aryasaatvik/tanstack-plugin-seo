/**
 * The `seo` CLI program (Bun runtime), wiring the three output planes:
 *  - **data** → stdout, via `Console.log` in the command handlers.
 *  - **status** → stderr, via `Logger.LogToStderr(true)`: the built-in loggers
 *    call `console.error`, so `Effect.log*` never touches stdout. The built-in
 *    `--log-level` flag (from `Command.run`) gates them.
 *  - **diagnostics** → stderr: an expected `SeoCliError` prints `✗ <message>`.
 *
 * This module is what `bin.ts` dynamic-imports, and it is the only place Effect
 * enters the package — which is what keeps Effect an *optional* peer dependency
 * that no consumer of `tanstack-plugin-seo` or `tanstack-plugin-seo/react` ever installs.
 *
 * Two Bun-specific wrinkles are handled here:
 *  - `Command.run` writes its help to stdout, so a flag typo would dump the full
 *    help there. Under Bun, `Console.log` bypasses `process.stdout.write` (it
 *    calls `console.log` natively), so the buffer intercepts `console.log`.
 *  - A graph loader may leave handles alive after the command finishes (the Vite
 *    loader's worker threads do), and the default teardown only force-exits on a
 *    non-zero code, so a custom teardown exits on success too.
