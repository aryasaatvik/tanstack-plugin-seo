/**
 * The `seo` bin. Deliberately trivial, and deliberately Effect-free.
 *
 * Effect and `@effect/platform-bun` are *optional* peer dependencies of
 * `tanstack-plugin-seo`: the library entries (`.`, `./react`, `./vite`, `./config`) never
 * touch them, so a consumer who only declares SEO on routes and renders heads
 * does not install them. Only this CLI does.
 *
 * Which means the CLI must survive their absence with a sentence rather than a
 * module-resolution stack trace. A static import of `./main` would be hoisted and
 * fail before any of our code runs, so the real program is loaded dynamically —
 * that import is the package boundary where Effect first appears, and this is the
 * only place that can catch it failing to resolve.

 * The resolution failure's message, or undefined if this was not one.

 * Keyed on `code` alone, never `instanceof Error`: Bun rejects an unresolvable
 * import with a `ResolveMessage`, which carries `code: "ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND"`
 * but is *not* an Error instance — an `instanceof` gate here would rethrow the
 * raw stack in exactly the case this exists to catch.
